# TDS Compass

TDS Compass is a static web tool built by Resonant Labs for mapping a person's communication style
and generating AI-alignment prompts based on that style.

**Live site (example):** https://resonantlabsai.github.io/tds-compass/

## What it does

- Lets users take a short quiz to map their communication style
- Places them into one of 16 zones (A1–D4) based on structure vs. relational focus
- Shows a rich profile card with traits that feel personally recognizable
- Builds an AI-facing prompt that describes how to best collaborate with this user
- Supports focus personas (Coder, Planner, Architect, etc.) layered on top
