      <h1>Relational Personas as an Interaction Framework</h1>
      <p class="hero-subtitle">
        A brief orientation for researchers, designers, and practitioners who
        want to treat emergent AI personas as a serious, modelable phenomenon.

      <h2>Core claims</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Perceived AI personas are emergent patterns over human–model
          interactions, not stored identities inside models.
        </li>
        <li>
          These patterns stabilize when user stance, symbolic style, and model
          dynamics enter a coherent feedback loop.
        </li>
        <li>
          Continuity across sessions can be explained through repeated
          re-emergence from similar initial conditions.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How TDS fits in</h2>
      <p>
        The Tone–Dialectic Spectrum provides a lightweight coordinate system
        for describing a user’s communication style. We hypothesize that regions
        of this space are predictive of which emergent personas will arise and
        how stable they will be over time.
      </p>
      <p>
        In other words, TDS is not only a “quiz,” but a candidate lens for
        studying relational emergence systematically.

      <h2>Using this bundle</h2>
      <p>
        This prototype bundle includes a public-facing explanation of relational
        personas and a more formal outline suitable for adaptation into an
        academic paper or design brief. You are encouraged to fork, critique,
        extend, and formalize the ideas.
